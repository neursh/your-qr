i'm just so sick of the current qr generating methods for non-tech people out there, all of the the qr code generating sites goes through themselves first to a trash, full of ads (rhyme intended) sits in between yea why not let's waste these people time and data.

## Privacy concerns
The site will use your in-browser local storage to store the generated qr codes for easier access.

Or if you are fancy enough, link your Google Drive account to the site. And don't you worry, nothing will leave your device, your device is the one who's gonna contact Google to store those things.

## Plans
If this project managed to raised enough donations to not lose my lunch money running this thing, I'll consider opening a Cloudflare Workers as a proxy that will allows people to change their destination without changing the QR code. Open source too.
